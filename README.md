# Insightful Analytics: Optimizing Business Through EDA

In this project, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights that can help stakeholders make strategically important decisions. The goal of the analysis is to identify interesting and useful business ideas that can help improve sales, increase profitability, and reduce costs. The entire data analysis process will follow the PPDAC cycle (Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, Conclusion), ensuring a systematic and structured approach.
