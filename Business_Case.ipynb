    "## Understanding the Categories of your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be divided into two categories, categorical (qualitative) and numerical (quantitative). These two categories can be split into two new categories, each. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Nominal Data**: Nominal data represents categories without any intrinsic ordering or ranking. It is used for labeling or naming attributes, where the numbers or labels are merely identifiers and do not imply a quantitative value or order. The focus is on \"naming\" or \"categorizing\" without an implied sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Data**: Ordinal data represents categories with a clear, inherent order, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily equal or known. Ordinal data indicates the position or rank of items in a sequence, where the relative ordering is significant, but the exact difference between ranks is not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete Data**: Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values where each value can be counted. It represents countable items and often involves integers. The key aspect of discrete data is the presence of a finite number of values between any two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Data**: Continuous data represents measurements and can take on any value within a given range. The range can be infinite, and the values are often represented by fractions or decimals. Continuous data can be subdivided infinitely, meaning that between any two values, there are potentially infinite other values."

    "\n",
    "Heatmaps provide a visual representation that is often more intuitive and easier to understand at a glance. We can quickly identify patterns of missing data. For example, you can easily spot if missing values are randomly distributed across the dataset or concentrated in specific rows or columns. Large areas of missing data might indicate problems in data collection or processing. In numerical summaries the patterns and extents of missing data might be overlooked, but the heatmap makes them immediately apperent.\n",
